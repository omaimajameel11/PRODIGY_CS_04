# Basic Keylogger Program

This is a basic Python program that records and logs keystrokes. The program logs the keys pressed by the user and saves them to a file. This project is intended for educational purposes, such as learning about how keylogging works and understanding cybersecurity risks.

## Ethical Considerations

**WARNING:** Keyloggers can be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing personal information, passwords, and other sensitive data. It is crucial to use this tool responsibly and ethically. **Only use this program on systems you own or have explicit permission to monitor. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.**

## Features

- Records and logs all keystrokes.
- Saves the logged keys to a file for later review.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library (Python library for controlling and monitoring input devices)

## How It Works
>> The keylogger uses the pynput library to listen to keyboard events.

>> Each key press is recorded and written to a log file.

>> Special keys (e.g., Enter, Space, Backspace) are logged with descriptive names.


## Important Notes
- Use with Permission: Always obtain explicit permission before running the keylogger on any system.
  
- Security Risks: Be aware that running keyloggers can expose sensitive information. Ensure that logs are stored securely and deleted when no longer needed.
  
- Legal Implications: Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal in many jurisdictions. Ensure you comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
